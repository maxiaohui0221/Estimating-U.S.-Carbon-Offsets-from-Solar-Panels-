# Estimating U.S. Carbon Offsets from Solar Panels ☀️🌱

**Timeframe:** Sep. 2024 – Dec. 2024  

## 📌 Overview
This project applies statistical sampling survey designs to estimate the total carbon offset generated by solar panels across the United States. Utilizing the "Project Sunroof" dataset, the study compares the efficiency and accuracy of four distinct sampling methods to determine the most representative approach for national-level estimation.

## 🎯 Objective
* To estimate the total carbon offset (in tons) from solar panels in the U.S.
* To evaluate and compare the standard error (SE) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) across different sampling designs.
* To identify the optimal sampling strategy for geographically diverse energy data.

## 🛠 Methodology
The project was conducted in **R**, involving data cleaning, rigorous statistical analysis, and variance estimation. The following sampling designs were implemented and compared:

1.  **Simple Random Sampling (SRS):** Baseline estimation.
2.  **Stratified Sampling:** Stratified by **State** to account for varying sunlight intensity and solar adoption rates across regions.
3.  **One-stage Cluster Sampling:** Treating states as clusters.
4.  **Two-stage Cluster Sampling:** Sub-sampling within selected state clusters.

## 📊 Key Results
* **Stratified Sampling** proved to be the most effective method, yielding the smallest Standard Error (SE) and the narrowest Confidence Interval compared to SRS and Cluster methods.
* **Why:** The analysis revealed significant variance *between* states (e.g., California vs. Delaware) regarding solar potential. Stratified sampling effectively captured this heterogeneity, preventing the overestimation bias observed in cluster sampling.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** `dplyr` (for data manipulation/sampling), `ggplot2` (for visualization).
* **Techniques:** Horvitz-Thompson Estimator, Standard Error Calculation, Confidence Interval Construction.

## 📂 Data Source
* [cite_start]**Dataset:** Google Project Sunroof (via Kaggle) [cite: 10, 240]
* **Variables:** 909 observations including State Name, Region, and Carbon Offset (tons).
